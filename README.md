# Formula one standings calculator
Season has <x> races. At the end of the race, pilots are awarded points:
1. 25 pts.
2. 18 pts.
3. 15 pts.
4. 12 pts.
5. 10 pts.
6. 8 pts.
7. 6 pts.
8. 4 pts.
9. 2 pts.
10. 1 pt.

Calculator accepts a collection of race results (driver finishing positions for each race), adds it up and returns a collection of driver standings with points. An index in these collections signifies a position ([0] is 1st, [1] is 2nd, etc).

Final season standings are calculated by adding up points for each pilot.

## Purpose
